# Security Policy

## 🔒 Our Security Commitment

Security is paramount in blockchain technology. Clutch Protocol is committed to maintaining the highest security standards to protect users, their funds, and their privacy in our decentralized ride-sharing ecosystem.

## 🛡️ Security Principles

### Core Security Values
- **Client-Side Signing**: Private keys never leave user devices
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Using proven algorithms (secp256k1, SHA256)
- **Decentralized Trust**: No single points of failure
- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions auditable on-chain
- **Privacy Protection**: Minimal data collection and storage

### Blockchain Security
- **Consensus Security**: Aura consensus with validator rotation
- **Transaction Integrity**: Cryptographic proof for all operations
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based transaction ordering
- **Network Security**: P2P encryption and authentication

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Active Development |
| < 0.1   | ❌ Pre-release      |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Critical Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** report it privately to our security team

### How to Report

**Primary Contact:**
- **Email:** mehran.mazhar@gmail.com
- **Subject:** [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability
- **PGP Key:** Available upon request for sensitive communications

**Required Information:**
Please include the following in your report:

```
1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact assessment
4. Suggested fix (if available)
5. Your contact information for follow-up
6. Whether you'd like to be credited in the fix
```

### Response Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 24 hours | Acknowledgment of report |
| 72 hours | Initial assessment and triage |
| 7 days | Detailed investigation results |
| 30 days | Fix development and testing |
| Coordinated | Public disclosure after fix |

## 🎯 Security Scope

### In Scope
- **Blockchain Core**: Consensus, validation, networking
- **Cryptographic Functions**: Signing, hashing, key management
- **API Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Transaction processing, fee distribution
- **Network Protocol**: P2P communication, message handling

### Out of Scope
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Report to respective maintainers
- **Social Engineering**: User education responsibility
- **Physical Security**: Hardware/device security
- **Denial of Service**: Network-level attacks
- **UI/UX Issues**: Non-security related interface problems

## 🏆 Security Rewards

### Bug Bounty Program
We operate a responsible disclosure program with recognition for security researchers:

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical**: Core protocol vulnerabilities, fund loss risks
- **High**: Authentication bypass, data exposure
- **Medium**: DoS vulnerabilities, information leakage  
- **Low**: Configuration issues, minor information disclosure

**Recognition:**
- Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- Hall of Fame listing
- Future governance token consideration
- Direct collaboration opportunities

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Private Key Management**: Use hardware wallets when possible
- **Software Updates**: Keep nodes and clients updated
- **Network Security**: Use secure connections (TLS/SSL)
- **Verification**: Verify transaction details before signing
- **Backup Strategy**: Secure key backup and recovery plans

### For Developers
- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in errors
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
- **Testing**: Include security test cases

### For Node Operators
- **System Security**: Keep OS and dependencies updated
- **Network Configuration**: Proper firewall and access controls
- **Monitoring**: Log and monitor for suspicious activity
- **Backup**: Regular configuration and data backups
- **Access Control**: Limit administrative access

## 📚 Security Resources

### Documentation
- [Blockchain Security Best Practices](./docs/security/)
- [API Security Guidelines](./docs/api-security.md)
- [Node Operation Security](./docs/node-security.md)

### Tools and Auditing
- **Static Analysis**: cargo clippy, rustfmt
- **Dependency Scanning**: cargo audit
- **Fuzzing**: cargo fuzz for critical functions
- **External Audits**: Professional security reviews

### Security Libraries
- **Cryptography**: ring, secp256k1
- **Networking**: tokio-tls, rustls
- **Serialization**: serde with validation

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns

### Never Do This
- Store private keys on servers
- Log sensitive information
- Use weak random number generation
- Skip input validation
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Trust client-side data without verification

### Red Flags
- Requests for private keys
- Unusual network activity
- Unexpected permission requests
- Suspicious dependency updates
- Social engineering attempts

## 📞 Emergency Response

### Critical Vulnerability Response
In case of a critical security issue affecting live systems:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
2. **Network Notification**: Alert node operators if needed
3. **Rapid Deployment**: Emergency patches for critical issues
4. **User Communication**: Clear, timely security advisories
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Learn and improve processes

### Communication Channels
- **Security Advisories**: GitHub Security Advisories
- **Emergency Alerts**: Email notifications to node operators
- **Community Updates**: GitHub Discussions and README updates
